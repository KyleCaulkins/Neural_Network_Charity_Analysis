# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to help a data scientist at **Alphabet Soup** build a model that can vet honest non-profits for financial support. Alphabet Soup is a large nonprofit organization that financially backs other nonprofit who help the environment, improve people's wellbeing, and unify the world. Unfortunately, some of the recipient organizations accept donations and then disappear. There is a need to predict which organizations are worth donating to and which are too high risk. The solution needs to be mathematical, data driven, and predict worthy organizations accurately. The following analysis is an attempt to meet this demand using deep learning.  

## Results

### Data Preprocessing
* The data used for processing 

* What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

* What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?

* What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

## Summary
Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
